# Courier

Courier is a utility designed to synchronize key-value (KV) pairs, policies, and general settings across multiple HashiCorp Vault clusters. Inspired by [jonasvinther/medusa](https://github.com/jonasvinther/medusa) and [pbchekin/vault-sync](https://github.com/pbchekin/vault-sync), Courier aims to provide a robust and easy-to-use solution for managing Vault configurations across various environments.
